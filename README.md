# sign-up-form
In this project I will apply all the skills I have learned so far in the 
intermediate html and css course in the odin project.
The main focus is using all the knowledge I have gained on creating forms
and also to practice using regular expressions more.
I will also use all the new css theory I have learned including using psuedo
classes and elements, advanced selectors, css variables, css functions if applicable 
and all the new properties I have discovered.
